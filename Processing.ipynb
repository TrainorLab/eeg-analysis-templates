Also included is the find_events() function, which extracts the trigger pulses from the recording and creates an N x 3 matrix of events that can later be used for epoching.

The .filter() method allows allows you to perform highpass, lowpass, or bandpass filtering using an FIR or IIR filter. The settings for both types of filters are explained below. **It is recommended that you filter your data prior to epoching.**\n",

First, it decomposes the channel data into its principal components via PCA in order to decorrelate the channels and re-scale them to unit variance. It then runs ICA on the PCA components. If *n_components* is set less than the number of channels in the data, dimensionality reduction is performed by dropping the last *n_channels* - *n_components* PCs prior to running ICA.\n",

    "ICA can be run either on continuous or epoched data. However, if using continuous data, be aware that highly irregular activity during break periods may reduce the quality of your ICA solution. ICA also has high memory requirements, so running it on epoched and/or downsampled data may be necessary if using a system with limited RAM.\n",

However, certain procedures such as re-referencing and interpolation can reduce the rank of your data, consequently reducing the maximum number of components you can actually decompose. Common average referencing will reduce the rank of your data by one. Channel interpolation further reduces the rank of your data by one for each interpolated channel. This is because the interpolated version of a channel is simply a weighted sum of other channels, meaning that its variance is entirely accounted for by those other channels. **You should therefore select a number of components equal to the number of channels in your data, subtracting one if you used an average reference, and subtracting an additional one for each channel you have interpolated.**\n",
